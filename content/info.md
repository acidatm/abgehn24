analog techno, digital visuals

ACIDATM is short for Acid At The Mall and is the alias of Johannes from Hamburg.

I release and perform dark, futuristic techno.

To me electronic music is the deepest form of connection between strangers.

What else is left, when the world becomes more and more complex? Tanzen, Techno, Trance.

I also program different video synthesizers as well as other digital visual media.
