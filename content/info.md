ACIDATM is short for Acid At The Mall.

Based on my Reddit username it became my primary alias for electronic music.

I release dark, futuristic, politically charged techno.

I work with hardware exclusively and focus primarily on live performance - releases mostly represent certain parts of my sets.

Techno is the purest form of connection between strangers to me.

And it might be the singular answer to most of the bigger questions I ask myself.

My music represents my view on the world, present and future.
