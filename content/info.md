formation of interactive spaces: analog techno/digital visuals

ACIDATM is short for Acid At The Mall.
The alias descends from my reddit username which descends from multiple sources, among other things the track "Acid at my house" by "Kid Paul".

I release and perform dark, futuristic techno.
I take strong influence from industrial, tribal, darkroom, dub and acid of cause.

To me electronic music is the deepest form of connection between strangers.

What else is left, when the world becomes more and more complex? Tanzen, Techno, Trance.

I also program different video synthesizers as well as other digital visual media.

I currently work as a software developer specialised in graphics programming and web technology.
I started studying fine arts at the HFBK in 2021.
