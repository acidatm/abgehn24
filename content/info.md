formation of interactive spaces: analog techno/digital visuals

ACIDATM is short for Acid At The Mall.

To me electronic music is the deepest form of connection between strangers.

What else is left, when the world becomes more and more complex? Tanzen, Techno, Trance.

I also program different video synthesizers as well as other digital visual media.

I currently work as a software developer specialised in graphics programming and web technology.
I started studying fine arts at the HFBK in 2021.
